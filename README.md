# NETFLIX-CLONE
Netflix is a streaming service that allows members to watch TV shows and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device. Here Netflix is cloned with its main functionalities like playing the movie trailers, suggesting trending, top-rated, action, comedy movies, etc.

## Concepts Used
- React JS
- Yarn
- Firebase

## FUNCTIONALITIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- The trending movie APIs are taken from The Movie Database, a community-built movie and TV database.
- Firebase is a set of hosting services for any application used for creating and storing web projects that act as the database but the data are stored in the cloud     and certain users can be disabled from authentication.
- Yarn is a package manager that is used for focussing on speed, security, and consistency which is better than npm.
- Axios is a JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from XML Http Requests from the browser and it supports the promise API.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
- To access the Firebase, a Firebase.js file should be created where Software
  Development KIT is set up.
- Here there is a configuration object containing keys and identifiers for the created
  web application.
- Movie Trailers are played from the you-tube links by installing react-you-tube and
  react-movie trailers.
