# NETFLIX-CLONE
Netflix is a streaming service that allows members to watch TV shows and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device. Here Netflix is cloned with its main functionalities like playing the movie trailers, suggesting trending, top-rated, action, comedy movies, etc.

## Concepts Used
- React JS
- Yarn
- Firebase

### FUNCTIONALITIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- The trending movie APIs are taken from The Movie Database, a community-built movie and TV database.
- Firebase is a set of hosting services for any application used for creating and storing web projects that act as the database but the data are stored in the cloud     and certain users can be disabled from authentication.
- Yarn is a package manager that is used for focussing on speed, security, and consistency which is better than npm.
- Axios is a JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from XML Http Requests from the browser and it supports the promise API.
 ### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
- To access the Firebase, a Firebase.js file should be created where Software
  Development KIT is set up.
- Here there is a configuration object containing keys and identifiers for the created
  web application.
- Movie Trailers are played from the you-tube links by installing react-you-tube and
  react-movie trailers.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
